# Introduction
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition characterized by challenges in social interaction, communication, and repetitive behaviors. Early detection and diagnosis are crucial for timely intervention, which can significantly improve outcomes for individuals with ASD. In this project, we developed a logistic regression model to assist in the early detection of autism spectrum disorder. Utilizing a dataset comprising various behavioral and developmental indicators, our model aims to provide a reliable, cost-effective, and accessible tool for screening ASD in diverse populations. By leveraging logistic regression, a widely used statistical method for binary classification, we strive to contribute to the growing efforts in early diagnosis and support for individuals with autism.
